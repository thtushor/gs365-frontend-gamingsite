            betting options, the app is rich and allows you to bet on any match,

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            Active players can join the GS365 VIP Club and receive extra
            benefits such as exclusive bonuses, monthly rewards, a personal VIP
            manager available 24/7, and more. The more you play or bet on GS365,
            the more VIP points you earn, which depend on the type of games you
            play. The total number of points you accumulate also determines your
            VIP level. You can use these points to earn extra money across
            various GS365 products. There are 5 VIP levels in total:

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            Players receive cashback of 1-3% of the amount they lose. This
            cashback percentage depends on the player’s VIP level.

            How does a player earn VIP points?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            A player's VIP points are counted only on the balance of their
            deposit, not on the bonus balance. For example: If a player deposits
            1,000 BDT and receives 1,000 BDT as a bonus, and the player wagers
            2,000 BDT, they will earn VIP points only on the 1,000 BDT deposited
            amount. (Similar to turnover, the player's deposited amount is
            counted first, and then VIP points are added to the player's
            profile.)
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            If a player wagers 100 BDT, 100 points will be added to their VIP
            points. Once the player reaches a minimum of 5,000 points, they can
            redeem/claim them. For example, if the player gets 1% cashback on
            losses according to their VIP level, they can claim 50 BDT for 5,000
            points, which will be added to their main balance without any
            turnover requirement.

            are rarely distorted and are developed by the bookmaker’s analysts.

          <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            Besides a wide selection of sports disciplines, tournaments, and
            matches, GS365 provides four types of bets to give every Bangladeshi
            bettor maximum variability. See them below:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-400">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Single</span>
              <br />
              This is a simple bet type with minimal risk, great for novice
              bettors. You can bet on one outcome in a match, and if your
              prediction is correct, you will get a payout according to the
              odds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Multiple</span>
              <br />
              This type of bet is complex, involving both single bets and
              expresses. It carries a high level of risk but offers significant
              payout potential, making it more suitable for experienced bettors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">System</span>
              <br />A system bet is a mix of several expresses, allowing you to
              lose one or more bets and still win part of the bet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Chain</span>
              <br />A chain consists of multiple single bets on unrelated
              outcomes. Each single bet stakes an amount equal to the stake on
              the first bet and rolls over on each winning bet. The order of
              betting determines which bets are fixed in the chain and the first
              option in the chain places a bet. This method reduces the risk of
              losing all your money while increasing the chances of winning.

            simple rules and addictive gameplay. The player’s goal is to get a
            combination of cards equal to or as close as possible to 21. Each
            card has a different value. If the player’s points exceed 21, they
            lose their bet. GS365 has several Blackjack tables where you can
