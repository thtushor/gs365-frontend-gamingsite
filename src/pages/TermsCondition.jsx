            <p>
              <strong>10.2.</strong> The winner of an event will be determined
              on the date of the event’s settlement, and we will not recognize
              protested or overturned decisions for wagering purposes. The

              be decided according to the wagering rules specified for that
              sport by us.

            <p>
              <strong>10.3.</strong> All results posted shall be final after 72
              hours and no queries will be entertained after that period of
              time. Within 72 hours after results are posted, we will only
              reset/correct results due to human error, system error or mistakes
              made by the referring results source.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>10.4.</strong> If a match result is overturned for any
              reason by the governing body of the match within the payout period
              then all money will be refunded.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>10.5.</strong> If a draw occurs in a game where a draw

              If a draw option is not offered then everyone receives a refund in

              <strong>10.8.</strong> Customers are solely responsible for their

              mistakes before sending them in. Once a transaction is complete,
              it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for missing or
              duplicate wagers made by the Customer and will not entertain
              discrepancy requests because a play is missing or duplicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>10.9.</strong> A game/match will have action regardless of
              the League heading that is associated with the matchup. A matchup
              will have action as long as the two teams are correct, and
              regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our
              Website.

              <strong>10.10.</strong> The start dates and times displayed on the
              Website for e-Sport matches are an indication only and are not
              guaranteed to be correct. If a match is suspended or postponed and
              not resumed within 72 hours from the actual scheduled start time,
              the match will have no action and wagers will be refunded, except
              wagers on tournament progression or winners which will remain
              valid.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>10.11.</strong> If an event is not played on the same date
              as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the event
              have no action. If an event is posted by us with an incorrect
              date, all wagers have action based on the date announced by the
              governing body.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>10.12.</strong> If a team is using stand-ins, the result
              is still valid as it was the team’s choice to use the stand-ins.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>10.13.</strong> The Company reserves the right to remove
              events, markets and any other products from the Website. An
              in-depth explanation of our sports betting rules is available on
